Users By Average Session Time

Interview Question Date: July 2021

Meta/Facebook Medium Interview Questions ID 10352 281

Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit. Output the user_id and their average session time.
